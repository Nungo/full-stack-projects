This job board website is a comprehensive platform built using React.js (with Vite), Node.js (using Express), Material-UI for styling, and MongoDB for data storage, with integration of SerpApi to fetch real-time job listings from Google Jobs. The website features a welcoming home page with featured listings, a job search and application process, detailed job pages, and dashboards for both employers (to manage postings and applications) and candidates (to manage profiles and track applications). Secure user authentication is implemented with JWT and bcrypt, and email notifications keep users updated on application statuses. The site is fully responsive, ensuring a seamless experience across devices. This project demonstrates expertise in modern web technologies, API integration, and responsive design, creating a robust and user-centric job board solution.
